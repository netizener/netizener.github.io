I"ä	<p>Some of you know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd">George Floyd</a>, some of you donâ€™t. Anyways, May 2020 was an extremely tense month for everyone in the world, from massive violent protests to an extreme surge in COVID-19 cases, it turned out to be one of the busiest and worst months of 2020 and changed a lot of things that we knew about in the world.</p>

<p>The whole event and its aftermath can be read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd">here on Wikipedia</a>, and I wonâ€™t be delving into anything related to racial discrimination and any of the â€œ#BlackLivesMatterâ€ movement, and keep this section pretty much controversy-free.</p>

<p>Speaking of controversy-free, GitHub recently changed their branch naming convention, and â€œ<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>â€ branches are now renamed to â€œ<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>â€ in all new repositories, which serves as the default branch of all repositories on GitHub. According to <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/">this article</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBoth Conservancy and the Git project are aware that the initial branch name, â€˜masterâ€™, is offensive to some people and we empathize with those hurt by the use of that term.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and its pretty sure inspired by racial-activists being offended by the old â€œmaster-slaveâ€ naming convention used in computer architectures since decades. I kind of understand their sentiments, but it isnâ€™t that easy to change your muscle memory from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push origin master</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push origin main</code> in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Still, I think its a good change, and I would request developers to check their repositories whether they refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch and avoid any unforeseen technical challenges and difficulties they might face due to the change in the naming convention, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code>. Its a handy tool, and will always help you cross-check your git repositoryâ€™s status.</p>
